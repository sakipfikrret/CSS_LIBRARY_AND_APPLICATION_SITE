## Why this project matters
- Polished, reusable components that accelerate product design and development.
- Thoughtful defaults that look great out of the box, but are easy to customize.
- Accessibility-first approach to ensure inclusive experiences.
- Clear structure to support teams of any size.

## Highlights
- Modular CSS (BEM-friendly structure, SCSS partials)
- Theme variables (colors, spacing, typography) and dark mode support
- Responsive, lightweight components (buttons, forms, cards, grids)
- Demo application pages to illustrate real-world usage
- Performance-minded (minimal selectors, critical CSS ready)

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sakipfikrret/CSS_L-BRARY_AND_APPlL-CAT-ON_S-TE.git
cd CSS_L-BRARY_AND_APPlL-CAT-ON_S-TE
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

3. Start the dev server
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

4. Build for production
```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

## Usage

Include compiled CSS in your project:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="dist/styles.css">
```

Or import SCSS partials for customization:
```scss
// Import variables first to override defaults
@import "library/_variables.scss";
@import "library/components/button";
```

Example HTML:
```html
<button class="btn btn-primary" aria-label="Primary action">Get Started</button>
```

## Theming & Customization
- Centralize tokens in /src/styles/_variables.scss
- Colors, font-sizes, breakpoints and spacing are configurable
- Use CSS custom properties for runtime theme switches
- Dark mode: add `.theme-dark` to the root element or use prefers-color-scheme media query

## Accessibility (a11y)
- Semantic HTML by default
- Keyboard-focused styles for interactive elements
- Ensure color contrast meets WCAG AA where possible
- Accessible form labels and ARIA attributes included in components

## Folder Structure (overview)
- /src — source SCSS, components, and utilities
- /examples — demo pages showing components in context
- /dist — compiled build artifacts
- /docs — design tokens and usage guides

## Best Practices
- Keep components small and single-responsibility
- Prefer utility classes for layout and spacing where appropriate
- Document new components with a demo and usage examples
- Add unit or visual regression tests for critical UI

## Testing & CI
- Unit tests: npm test
- Visual regression testing recommended for key views
- Integrate linting and style checks in CI (prettier, stylelint)
